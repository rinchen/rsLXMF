rsLXMF is a Rust implementation of LXMF, the Reticulum messaging layer. This is not a fork of LXMF, this is LXMF written in a different language focused on staying interoperable. This is not a source of truth implementation, do not use it as such.

Commands are intentionally namespaced for Rust with the Rust-specific `lxmd-rs` command, so rsLXMF can live beside other
LXMF daemons on `PATH` without worry.

## Build It

The current development layout for rsLXMF requires
rsReticulum as a sibling directory/repo next to it, such as:

```text
ratspeak-src/
|-- rsReticulum/
`-- rsLXMF/
```
If you're starting fresh:
```bash
mkdir ratspeak-src
cd ratspeak-src
git clone https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum
git clone https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF
cd rsLXMF
```

### macOS

Install Rust with `rustup`, then install Apple's build tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Build from the sibling checkout:

```bash
cd rsLXMF
cargo build --release --locked
```

### Linux / Raspberry Pi

#### Install Rust with `rustup`, then install the needed packages:

Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libudev-dev
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make pkgconf-pkg-config systemd-devel
```

Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pkgconf systemd
```

#### Build the daemon:

```bash
cd rsLXMF
cargo build --release --locked
```

### Windows

Install Rust with the MSVC toolchain. If Rust or Cargo asks for Visual Studio
Build Tools, install the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

Build from PowerShell:

```powershell
cd rsLXMF
cargo build --release --locked
```

After the build, use the commands below with `./target/release/lxmd-rs` on
macOS/Linux or `.\target\release\lxmd-rs.exe` on Windows.

## Operating lxmd-rs

`lxmf-tools` builds one public command name:

| Binary | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| lxmd-rs | Rust LXMF daemon and control utility. |



Generate the example config:

```bash
lxmd-rs --exampleconfig
```

Run a regular LXMF daemon:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum
```

Run a propagation node:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --propagation-node
```

Send a message and exit:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum \
  --send <destination_hash> "message body"
```

The `--send` flag is an rsLXMF convenience. Normal
daemon and propagation-control operation does not require it for anything.

Send UTF-8 file content or select a delivery method:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum \
  --send <destination_hash> --send-file ./message.txt --send-method direct
```

Supported `--send-method` values are `opportunistic`, `direct`, and
`propagated`. Paper messages aren't supported yet in the CLI.

Attach custom LXMF fields from scripts:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum \
  --send <destination_hash> "with fields" \
  --send-fields-json '{"1":"aGVsbG8=","42":"AAECAw=="}'
```

The JSON object maps field IDs to base64-encoded bytes. It is only a shell
convenience; LXMF fields remain MessagePack field maps on the wire.

Control a propagation node:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --status
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --peers
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --sync <peer_hash>
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --break <peer_hash>
```

These commands query an `lxmf.propagation.control` endpoint over Reticulum.
They do not inspect local files and do not start local daemon state. If no
reachable daemon answers, they time out with compatibility-oriented control
exit behavior.

For a remote propagation node, pass the node's propagation destination hash:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum \
  --status --peers --remote <propagation_destination_hash> --timeout 5
```

Control queries use `<config-dir>/identity` by default. Use `--identity PATH`
when the query should authenticate as a different LXMF identity.

Run an inbound hook:

```bash
lxmd-rs --config ~/.rsLXMF --rnsconfig ~/.rsReticulum --on-inbound /path/to/handler
```

The handler receives the saved `.lxm` message path as an argument.

## Configuration

`lxmd-rs --config <dir>` expects a directory and reads `<dir>/config`.
`lxmd-rs --rnsconfig <dir>` expects a Reticulum config directory.

If no LXMF config directory is supplied, the default is:

| Platform | Default LXMF config file |
| --- | --- |
| Linux/macOS | `/etc/rsLXMF/config`, then `~/.config/rsLXMF/config`, then `~/.rsLXMF/config` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\rsLXMF\config` |


If `--rnsconfig` is omitted, Reticulum config resolution follows
rsReticulum-specific defaults.

Recommended standalone locations:

| Environment | LXMF config | Reticulum config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS/Linux desktop | `~/.rsLXMF/config` | `~/.rsReticulum/config` |
| Windows desktop | `%APPDATA%\rsLXMF\config` | `%APPDATA%\rsReticulum\config` |
| Linux service | `/var/lib/rsLXMF/config` | `/etc/rsReticulum/config` or another explicit Reticulum directory |

Use existing LXMF or Reticulum directories, such as `~/.lxmd`, `~/.lxmf`, or
`~/.reticulum`, only by passing them explicitly. That keeps the default install
isolated while still allowing deliberate drop-in and migration tests.

Minimal config:

```ini
[lxmf]
display_name = Rat
announce_at_start = no
# stamp_cost = 12
delivery_transfer_max_accepted_size = 1
# on_inbound = /path/to/handler

[propagation]
enable_node = no
announce_at_start = yes
autopeer = yes
autopeer_maxdepth = 6
auth_required = no
# node_name = Rat Nest
# static_peers = e17f833c4ddf8890dd3a79a6fea8161d
# outbound_node = e17f833c4ddf8890dd3a79a6fea8161d
# max_peers = 20
# propagation_stamp_cost_target = 16
# propagation_stamp_cost_flexibility = 3

[logging]
loglevel = 4
```

The standalone daemon follows current Python LXMF 1.1.0 and defaults this
setting to 1 decimal KB when it is omitted. This is intentionally distinct
from the reusable router library's 1000 KB default. Applications that accept
larger incoming messages should set their own explicit policy.

Supported sections:

| Section | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| `[lxmf]` | `display_name`, `announce_at_start`, `announce_interval`, `delivery_transfer_max_accepted_size`, `stamp_cost`, `on_inbound` |
| `[propagation]` | `enable_node`, `node_name`, `auth_required`, `announce_at_start`, `announce_interval`, `autopeer`, `autopeer_maxdepth`, `message_storage_limit`, `propagation_message_max_accepted_size`, `propagation_sync_max_accepted_size`, `propagation_stamp_cost_target`, `propagation_stamp_cost_flexibility`, `peering_cost`, `remote_peering_cost_max`, `max_peers`, `static_peers`, `prioritise_destinations`, `control_allowed`, `from_static_only`, `outbound_node`, `propagation_stamp_cost`, `propagation_limit`, `enforce_stamps` |
| `[control]` | `auth_required`, `allowed` |
| `[logging]` | `loglevel` |

Optional hash-list files live next to `<config-dir>/config`:

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ignored` | Hashes loaded into the router ignored list. |
| `allowed` | Hashes loaded into the router delivery allow-list. Empty means no allow-list restriction. |

Hash-list files accept one raw 32-character hex destination hash per line.

## Delivery Model

LXMF supports several delivery shapes. rsLXMF exposes them through the router
and, where network-backed, through `lxmd-rs --send-method`.

| Method | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Opportunistic | Single-packet delivery when the packed message fits the Reticulum packet path. Delivery completes only after an authenticated Reticulum proof; bounded retries remain in flight until then. Oversized opportunistic messages are downgraded to Direct by the router. |
| Direct | Link-backed delivery over a Reticulum Link, with resource transfer for larger content. |
| Propagated | Store-and-forward delivery through a propagation node, including deposit, retrieve, peer sync, stamps, and tickets. |
| Paper | Library support for `lxm://` URI generation and ingest. The CLI does not generate QR images. |

Direct and propagation Links use ordinary Reticulum path discovery only for
their initial LINKREQUEST. After a valid LRPROOF, rsLXMF pins the Link to that
proof's ingress interface and all later packets, Resources, proofs, keepalives,
and teardown use the same interface. A lost interface closes the Link instead
of silently rerouting it. Reverse Direct delivery is published only after its
role-correct proof has been admitted to that bound endpoint.

An ordinary direct or opportunistic LXMF message is a signed Reticulum payload:

```text
destination_hash  16 bytes
source_hash       16 bytes
signature         64 bytes
payload           MessagePack([timestamp, title, content, fields, optional_stamp])
```

`title` and `content` are bytes on the wire. `fields` is a `map<u8, bytes>` for
application-defined data such as tickets, attachments, location data, or
application envelopes.

Library callers requesting a reply ticket set `include_ticket`, call
`LxmRouter::prepare_outbound`, and then sign the message. The router rejects a
requested ticket that would require changing an already-signed message.


## Feature Status

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Message format | Signed LXMF envelopes, custom field maps, standard reply/reaction/comment fields, propagation wrappers, `.lxm` containers, and paper URI encode/decode. |
| Delivery | Opportunistic, Direct, Propagated, callbacks, failure callbacks, cancellation, progress state, opportunistic-to-direct downgrade, and compression signalling in delivery announces. |
| Propagation | Transactional disk-backed store, deposit, retrieve, peer sync, autopeer/static peers, weighted culling, duplicate checks, size checks, and stamp checks. |
| Stamps and tickets | Soft/hard stamp validation, HKDF-expanded workblocks, cached destination stamp costs, automatic reply-ticket issue and signed learning, ticket-backed stamps, and restart-safe directional persistence. |
| Control | `--status`, `--peers`, `--sync`, and `--break` over the propagation-control link. |
| Access lists | `ignored` and `allowed` hash-list files in the LXMF config directory. |

## Compatibility Notes

Most daemon and control flags are implemented: `--config`, `--rnsconfig`,
`--propagation-node`, `--on-inbound`, `--status`, `--peers`, `--sync`,
`--break`, `--remote`, `--identity`, `--timeout`, `--exampleconfig`, and
`--version`.

Additional rsLXMF-only flags: `--send`, `--send-file`, `--send-method`,
`--send-timeout-secs`, and `--send-fields-json`.

The complete release-baseline corpus and live matrix use Python LXMF 1.0.1
with Reticulum 1.4.2. A supplementary lane checks daemon, delivery,
Resource/proof, and propagation behavior against exact LXMF 1.1.0 with the
same Reticulum 1.4.2 source. Historical vectors retain their original
provenance, and RNS 1.5.0 is intentionally deferred.

If the issue or contribution belongs upstream as well, start there. Python LXMF
and Reticulum remain the reference implementations.

PRs are closed for now until I have time to catch up on everything. I'm tired.
